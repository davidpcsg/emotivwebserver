# Emotiv Web Server

This repository is part of the **Hot and Cold Game**. 

The Hot and Cold is a game where the player commands a wheeled robot (Turtlebot3 Waffle) with the brain (EMOTIV Insight 5 channel mobile EEG) guiding it to a goal. The purpose of **emotivwebserver** is to read a REST/JSON API with the EMOTIV signals and expose them through a user friendly web interface.
